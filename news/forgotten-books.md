snippet: Using Unseen Species models on Cultural data
---

We recently published an article in Science about estimating the amount of medieval lost
books using ecological models. Check out the paper
[here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7655). As part of our communication
efforts, we also created an accompanying [website](https://forgotten-books.netlify.app),
which provide some additional details about the project. Last but not least, we made an
author explanation video, in which collaborators involved in this project provide a
high-level explanation of our project and results.
