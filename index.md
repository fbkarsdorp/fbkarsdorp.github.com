# Folgert Karsdorp

I'm a researcher in Computational Humanities and Cultural Evolution at the [Meertens
Institute](https://www.meertens.knaw.nl) of the [Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and
Sciences](https://www.knaw.nl) (Amsterdam, the Netherlands). 

My research focuses on why some cultural phenomena are adopted and persist through time,
while others change or disappear. Additionally, I'm interested in measuring cultural
diversity and compositional complexity, and how we can account for biases in our
estimations of diversity. To do that, I use computational models from Machine Learning,
Cultural Evolution, and Ecology.

Besides cultural change and diversity, I'm also interested in teaching about computer
programming in the context of the Humanities. I published a text book with Princeton
University Press about using Python for [Humanities data
analysis](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691172361/humanities-data-analysis).
