  abstract =     {In this paper, we show that analogy is a possible cognitive mechanism
                  behind linguistic categorization. Given a formalized stochastic model
                  that shows preference for certain forms as analogues over other forms,
                  the argument that analogy is a void notion because it is unrestricted
                  (Chomsky 1986) no longer applies. As a test case we tried to predict the
                  alternation between the two patterns of forming the superlative in
                  Dutch. Using the Memory-Based Learning model (Daelemans & Van den Bosch
                  2005), we can predict 67\% of the variation on the basis of three
                  features. In a follow-up experiment , the effect of a fourth factor,
                  collocational attraction between the adjective and the noun, was
                  investigated. Starting from a different level of exemplar granularity,
                  this model accounted for 93\% of the cases in the data-set.}

                  speelt in het theoretisch model van Construction Morphology zoals
                  ontwikkeld door Booij (2010). In Construction Morphology worden
                  woordvormingspatronen en productiviteit verantwoord door constructionele
                  schema‘s en subschema‘s. Analogie wordt geïnterpreteerd als strikt
                  locale analogie die kan leiden tot een nieuwvorming op basis van een
                  modelwoord. Schema‘s en analogie zijn dus complementair en verschillen
                  in de graad van abstractie, waarbij analogie het uitgangspunt kan zijn
                  voor het ontstaan van een schema. Regelmatige productieve woordvorming
                  en analogische nieuwvorming zijn in deze benadering – anders dan
                  bijvoorbeeld in generatieve benaderingen – geen absolute
                  tegenstellingen, maar ze moeten desondanks volgens Booij wel duidelijk
                  worden onderscheiden van elkaar. Wij willen echter laten zien dat het
                  model wel degelijk ruimte biedt voor een ruimer analogiebegrip, waarbij
                  analogie kan worden gezien als het centrale mechanisme van (ook

                  with a strong lopsidedness towards shorter time-spans between stories

                  long reproduction history. Drawing on insight from literary theory,
                  theoretical linguistics, and cultural evolution theory, we argue that
                  changes in the cultural entrenchment of fairy tales and folk stories are
                  reflected in (small) structural ‘mutations’ in the story. More
                  specifically, we aim to show that with the increasing familiarity
                  of“Little Red Riding Hood”, its story frame and characters have
                  gradually become part of the author and audience’s shared world
                  knowledge, which is encoded in the type of linguistic devices used to
                  introduce the characters. To this end, we performed a Bayesian logistic
                  regression analysis on a diachronic collection (late 18th century – 2015)
                  of the world’s most iconic fairy tale, using automatically generated time

                  increase of linguistic markers that indicate that the characters are
                  already known or “accessible” to the audience. This development reflects
                  the author’s changing intuitions and beliefs about the familiarity of the
                  story, and, indirectly, the changing expectations of the story’s audience
                  regarding the appearance of certain characters in the story
                  frame. Notably, this study is the first to quantitatively describe the
                  diachronic development of a story (and the concepts associated with it)
                  into the realm of ‘shared knowledge’, showing that it is a slow and
                  gradual process. The results help refine our understanding of cultural
                  evolution as well as the workings of speaker-addressee dynamics.
                  Conceptualising the observed linguistic mutations as an instance of
                  guided variation, we argue that the increase of definite first mentions as
                  a function of cultural entrenchment can be treated as an example of
                  variation guided by pragmatic principles such as Grice’s Maxim of
                  Quantity, making character introductions as informative as (and not
                  more informative than) required.}

  abstract =     {Similarity measures are indispensable in music information retrieval. In
                  recent years, various proposals have been made for measuring melodic
                  similarity in symbolically encoded scores. Many of these approaches are
                  ultimately based on a dynamic programming approach such as sequence
                  alignment or edit distance, which has various drawbacks. First, the
                  similarity scores are not necessarily metrics and are not directly
                  comparable. Second, the algorithms are mostly first-order and of
                  quadratic time-complexity, and finally, the features and weights need to
                  be defined precisely. We propose an alternative approach which employs
                  deep neural networks for end-to-end similarity metric learning. We
                  contrast and compare different recurrent neural architectures (LSTM and
                  GRU) for representing symbolic melodies as continuous vectors, and
                  demonstrate how duplet and triplet loss functions can be employed to
                  learn compact distributional representations of symbolic music in an
                  induced melody space. This approach is contrasted with an
                  alignment-based approach. We present results for the Meertens Tune
                  Collections, which consists of a large number of vocal and instrumental
                  monophonic pieces from Dutch musical sources, spanning five centuries,
                  and demonstrate the robustness of the learned similarity metrics.}

                  himself has authored at least part of these commentaries, the authorship
                  of the rest of the texts remains a puzzle that has persisted for
                  nineteen centuries. In particular, the role of Caesar’s general Aulus
                  Hirtius, who has claimed a role in shaping the corpus, has remained in
                  contention. Determining the authorship of documents is an increasingly
                  important authentication problem in information and computer science,
                  with valuable applications, ranging from the domain of art history to
                  counter-terrorism research. We describe two state-of-the-art authorship
                  verification systems and benchmark them on 6 present-day evaluation

                  contemporary songs stand a greater chance of reaching #1 of the
                  Billboard’s hit chart when their lyrics are more repetitive (Nunes,
                  Ordanini, and Valsesia 2015; Alexander 1996; Ellis et al. 2015; Bradlow
                  and Fader 2001). This preference for repetitive structures is a
                  well-known cognitive bias (see e.g. Rubin 1995), yet little is known
                  about whether similar preferences were at play in historical popular
                  song lyrics. The current study aims to address this question by
                  quantitatively modelling the relationship between popularity and various
                  forms of repetition in the lyrics of a large-scale collection of
                  historical songs and, subsequently, relating our findings to
                  observations in the modern era. While we acknowledge the effect of
                  musical repetition on a song’s popularity and the way this can affect

                  expected that melodic and textual formulas at the end of the phrases

                  contour, rhythmic, textual, and contextual features, and a group of
                  features based on the conditions of closure as stated by Narmour

                  of the classifier is considerably improved by taking the class labels of
