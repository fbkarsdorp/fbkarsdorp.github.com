      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bias-in-historical-records&#34;&gt;Bias in historical records&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;a href=&#34;https://2022.computational-humanities-research.org&#34;&gt;Computational Humanities Research conference 2022&lt;/a&gt; held in Antwerp from December 12&#xA;to 14, I co-presented a new paper with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.melvinwevers.nl/&#34;&gt;Melvin Wevers&lt;/a&gt; on missing data in historical&#xA;archives. The paper was pubslished with CEUR-WS and can be found here:&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/short_paper1793.pdf&#34;&gt;https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/short_paper1793.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. Missing data is rather the norm than the&#xA;exception in historical archives. There are virtually endless reasons why records did not&#xA;survive the test of time: they might have been lost due to natural causes, such as fires,&#xA;decisions on the level of archival policy making, but also due to content production&#xA;biases. When working with incomplete data archives, we run into all kinds of risk, such as&#xA;overestimating the impact of specific historical events, misrepresenting class, and&#xA;underestimating casualties. For this reason, we need to critically evaluate whether the&#xA;data we are left with is representative of the archival collection or historical period&#xA;from which its stems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;functional-diversity&#34;&gt;Functional Diversity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some previous notebooks (see, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.karsdorp.io/posts/20220309103709-good_turing_as_an_unseen_species_model/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.karsdorp.io/posts/20220323122150-estimating_richness_under_sampling_without_replacement/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.karsdorp.io/posts/20220316142536-two_assemblage_good_turing_estimation/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I have discussed the&#xA;concept of cultural diversity and how methods from ecology can be used to estimate the&#xA;lower bound of unseen cultural diversity. In these notebooks, diversity was understood&#xA;simply as the number of unique items in a collection (e.g., species, narratives, pictures,&#xA;melodies, etc.), with all elements being considered as equidistant, or, in other words,&#xA;categorically different. Of course, it only rarely, if ever, happens that all items are&#xA;exactly equally different from each other. It is much more likely that some species are&#xA;more similar than others. And the same is true of cultural artefacts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimating Richness under Sampling without Replacement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Unseen Species Models&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;Chao1&lt;/a&gt; assume that the sample being studied was created with&#xA;replacement. This means that calculations are based on the assumption that certain&#xA;individuals can or have been repeatedly observed. It also implies that the observation of&#xA;one individual does not influence the observation of the next individual. That is to say:&#xA;observations are independent. Take, for example, an ecologist who wants to use Chao1 to&#xA;estimate the number of unique animal species that live in a given environment. Assuming&#xA;for the moment that the presence of the researcher in that environment does not introduce&#xA;any observation biases, we can think of the observation process as a sample with&#xA;replacement: upon registration, animals are &lt;em&gt;re-placed&lt;/em&gt; into the environment, and thus&#xA;there is chance that ecologist is observing the same animal twice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
