      <description>Functional Diversity In some previous notebooks (see, for example, here, here, and here), I have discussed the concept of cultural diversity and how methods from ecology can be used to estimate the lower bound of unseen cultural diversity. In these notebooks, diversity was understood simply as the number of unique items in a collection (e.g., species, narratives, pictures, melodies, etc.), with all elements being considered as equidistant, or, in other words, categorically different.</description>

      <description>Unseen Species Models such as Chao1 assume that the sample being studied was created with replacement. This means that calculations are based on the assumption that certain individuals can or have been repeatedly observed. It also implies that the observation of one individual does not influence the observation of the next individual. That is to say: observations are independent. Take, for example, an ecologist who wants to use Chao1 to estimate the number of unique animal species that live in a given environment.</description>
