      <description>This is a transcript of a talk given at the CHR2022 conference. For the corresponding paper, see https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/short_paper2780.pdf.
Lexical diversity One of the simplest and most basic corpus statistics is the number of unique words in a text. This number gives us a quick and straightforward picture of the lexical diversity of a text. Lexical diversity is typically implemented by measuring the number of unique letter combinations. This is of course very easy to do, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily describe the lexical richness of a text adequately.</description>

      <title>Estimating Unseen Shared Cultural Diversity</title>

      <description>Shared Species Estimation In Demystifying Chao1 with Good-Turing, I tried to explain the intuition behind the Chao1 estimator (Chao 1984) for unseen species using the Good-Turing estimator as described in Chao et al. (2017). The latter article discusses another set of diversity measures within that same framework of Turing. The number of unique species or the number of unique cultural artifacts in a given environment is only one diversity measure, but we can also study the shared diversity between two cultural collections, for example.</description>

      <title>Population Size Estimation as a Regression Problem</title>

      <description>Unseen heterogeneity Unseen Species Models such as Chao1 provide accurate point-estimates of the population size when the rare species in studied sample are homogeneous. That is, in the case of animal species, for example, all species are equally likely to be observed. Of course, this is a simplifying assumption. Some species are simply more difficult to spot than others, and so most samples contain unseen heterogeneity. When such heterogeneity is present in a sample, the Chao1 estimate reduces to a lower bound of the actual population size.</description>

      <title>Zelterman&#39;s Estimator of Population Size</title>

      <description>Zelterman&amp;rsquo;s Estimator In Demystifying Chao1 with Good-Turing, I introduced and explained the Chao1 estimator as an example of a well-known model for estimating the number of unseen species. In this notebook, I study some aspects of another, alternative estimator developed in Zelterman (1988), which has been popular in applications such as drug user studies. This estimator has particular properties that make it more robust or less sensitive to violations of the underlying model.</description>

      <title>Estimating Richness under Sampling without Replacement</title>

      <description>Unseen Species Models such as Chao1 assume that the sample being studied was created with replacement. This means that calculations are based on the assumption that certain individuals can or have been repeatedly observed. It also implies that the observation of one individual does not influence the observation of the next individual. That is to say: observations are independent. Take, for example, an ecologist who wants to use Chao1 to estimate the number of unique animal species that live in a given environment.</description>

      <description>To estimate the &amp;ldquo;biodiversity&amp;rdquo; in a particular area &amp;ndash; or, in other words, the number of unique species living in a given environment &amp;ndash; ecologists usually have no other option than to rely on incomplete samples. For all sorts of practical reasons, it is virtually impossible to spot all species that are actually present in an area, and hence certain species will be missing in the counts. Consequently, an important research question in ecology is how to reliably estimate the resulting &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo; between the number of species that was observerd and the true number of unique species in an area.</description>
